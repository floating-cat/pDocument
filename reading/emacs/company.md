Completion will start automatically after you type a few letters. Use M-n and M-p to select, <return> to complete or <tab> to complete the common part. Search through the completions with C-s, C-r and C-o. Press M-(digit) to quickly complete with one of the first 10 candidates.

When the completion candidates are shown, press <f1> to display the documentation for the selected candidate, or C-w to see its source. Not all back-ends support this.

# My Usage
