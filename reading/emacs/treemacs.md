For navigation use n/p (j/k when evil), M-n/M-p to move to same-height neighbour u to go to parent, and C-n/C-k to move between projects.

You can also open a file in a specific window by dragging using left click from treemacs to the required window.

Can I expand everything under a node?
Yes, you just need to expand it with a prefix argument. Closing nodes with a prefix argument works as well. In this case treemacs will forget about the nodes opened below the one that was closed and not reopen them automatically.
